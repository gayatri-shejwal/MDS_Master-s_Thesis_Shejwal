# Changing Cognitive Capital: A Conjoint Study on the Impact of AI Adoption on Skill Demand

This repository contains the data processing and analysis code for my Master's thesis in Data Science for Public Policy at the Hertie School (2025). The study investigates how organizational AI adoption influences employer preferences for candidate skills across generalist and specialist job roles.

## Method Summary

The experiment employs a between-subjects 2×2 factorial design (AI Framing × Job Role), followed by five forced-choice conjoint tasks per respondent. Candidate attributes are randomized within each task, allowing estimation of causal effects of context and skill profiles on employer choice in the form of Average Component Preferences (ACPs) and Conditional Average Component Preferences (CACPs).
